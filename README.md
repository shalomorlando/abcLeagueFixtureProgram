# abcLeagueFixtureProgram

The abcFixtureProgram was built at the end of my Data Structures and Algorithms class in my second year of University.

The instructions were as follows:

In ABC premier league, there are 10 teams.
You have been hired to build a program that will generate fixtures for these teams based on the following given rules.  
        1. A team must play every other team twice, i.e. in their home stadium and away stadium. At some point, teams from the same 
        local town will have to play each other, these teams should only meet after they have played teams from other local towns.  
        
        2. Only 4 teams can play in a given weekend, for example CKlein Stars vs Dolpins FC and Wolves FC vs SeaHorses FC.  
        
        3. While developing the fixtures, indicate the local town, stadium, leg (i.e. 1 or 2) and the weekend (indicate as weekend 
        #1, weekend #2 etc.) the teams are meant to meet.  
        
        4.Display the final table in a CSV file (and on screen) to show the generated fixtures (10 Marks) 
        Marking guidelines 

1. User feedback should be good and very comprehensive, creativity will be highly rewarded.

2. You may generate your own csv file or template to import the teams into the program as an array, do not have static teams in the program.

3. Appropriate solution is required.  

WHAT I LEARNT:

        1. From this project i learnt how to import and manipulate CSV files using native java classes.
        2. I also learnt how to write into CSV files.
        3. I learnt how to use java data structures such as <arrayList> and <List> in programs.
